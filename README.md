# Using Google Street View Images to Predict Party Affiliation in US Congressional Districts
This project collects images from Google Street View and uses them to predict the party affiliation of US Congressional Districts. It explores feature engineering, multiple modeling approaches, and transfer learning (VGG16, and landscape classification tasks). The final model achieves an accuracy of 81% on the test set.

This is a joint project by Elie Eshoa, Luke Stoner, and Daniela Shuman.
